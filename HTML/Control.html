		<h2>The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect</h2>
		<hr>
		<br><p>Many people have heard of the "greenhouse effect", but not everyone knows what the "greenhouse effect" is exactly. The greenhouse effect refers to the way that certain gasses in earth's atmosphere keep the planet warmer than it would otherwise be. The earth's greenhouse effect is a natural occurrence that helps raise our planet's average temperature, making it habitable. Without naturally occurring greenhouse gasses like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane, more of Earth's energy would radiate back into space and Earth's average temperature would be about -1F, which is about 60F colder than it is today. Life on Earth would be much different without a greenhouse effect. In fact, life might not exist on Earth at all without the greenhouse effect.<br><br>So how does the greenhouse effect work? Energy in the form of visible light from the sun enters Earth's atmosphere. Clouds and other particles in the atmosphere reflect about 26% of this solar energy back into space. Some of this incoming solar energy (about 19%) is absorbed by clouds, gasses, and other atmospheric particles. But because the atmosphere is mostly transparent to visible light, about 55% of the solar energy passes through the atmosphere and reaches Earth's surface. A small portion of this solar energy (about 4%) is reflected back into space by the earth's surface. But most (51%) of the energy from the sun is absorbed by the earth's land and oceans. An analogy may help illustrate this process.<br><br>Imagine your car parked out in the sun with the windows slightly open. The temperature inside your car feels warmer than the outside temperature. The reason for this difference in temperature is that the sun's light energy enters through the car windows and is transferred to the seats, dashboard, carpeting, and floor mats. These objects re-radiate some of this energy in a form of invisible light, called infrared. Windows are opaque to and block this infrared light, causing the energy to be trapped inside the car. Some of the blocked energy is transferred to the air inside the car, raising its temperature. This is an example of a greenhouse effect. Similarly, Earth is covered by a blanket of gasses, which, like the windows on the car, allow light energy from the sun to pass through to the earth's surface, but block some infrared light from returning to space.<br><br>The naturally occurring greenhouse effect keeps the earth habitable, but an enhanced greenhouse effect is responsible for current global warming. Scientific observations confirm that the average global temperature is rising. Surface temperatures have increased since 1880, with most of the warming occurring since the 1970s. Moreover, the twenty warmest years on record have occurred since 1981 with the top ten taking place in the last twelve years. The rapid warming that the earth is currently experiencing cannot be explained by natural factors alone. The climate can and is being changed by humans. In fact, almost all climate scientists (97%) agree that human activities have added to the natural greenhouse effect. As the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere increases, more infrared light is absorbed and re-radiated, in turn; the earth's surface is further warmed. The additional warming of Earth due to increased greenhouse gasses concentrations caused by human activities (such as the burning of fossil fuels) is called the enhanced greenhouse effect. It is this human enhanced greenhouse effect that is causing global warming. To continue the car analogy, humans have the ability to influence the windows on the car, and we have been slowly rolling the windows up.<br><br>The main greenhouse gasses entering the atmosphere through human activities include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gasses. The increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere comes mainly from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and by deforestation (the clearing of forests which naturally absorb carbon dioxide). Methane is given off when coal and oil is produced and transported, by raising livestock and other agricultural practices, and through the decay of organic waste in landfills. Nitrous oxide is emitted into the atmosphere through industrial and agricultural practices, as well as through the combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste. Fluorinated gasses are also being released into the atmosphere through industrial processes and are contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Although all of these gasses contribute to the enhanced greenhouse effect, carbon dioxide is the gas you probably have heard about the most because it accounts for more than 60% of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Most of the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions result from fossil fuel combustion used to generate electric power and exhaust from cars, trucks, airplanes, and trains. We all know the warnings about leaving a child or pet in a locked car with the windows up on a sunny day. If global warming is not mitigated, we run the risk of Earth's temperature rising to unsafe levels.</p><br>
